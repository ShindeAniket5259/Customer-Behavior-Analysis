# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
Data Analytics Project showcasing customer behavior Analysis Using Python, SQL and Power BI.

# Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from loading raw data in Python to creating an interactive Power BI dashboard and presenting findings in a Gamma presentation.
The main objective is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset by cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data effectively.

# Dataset

Source: Public dataset (or internal company data — specify if known)

Format: CSV / Excel / SQL Table

Size: Approx. 3900 rows × 18 columns

Content: Contains information about [briefly describe the data, e.g., customer purchases, sales transactions etc.]

# Tools & Technologies

# Tool	Purpose
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)	Running complex queries, data extraction, and aggregation
Power BI	Data visualization and dashboard creation
Gamma.app	Interactive presentation/report creation
Excel (optional)	Initial data checks and duplicates removal

# Steps Followed
1. Data Loading

Imported dataset into Python using Pandas

Verified column names, data types, and structure

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers

Analyzed distributions, correlations, and trends

Visualized key metrics using bar charts, boxplots, and heatmaps

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns

Converted data types and standardized categorical values

4. SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned dataset into  MySQL

Performed analytical queries such as:

Top 5 products/customers by revenue

Monthly sales trends

Average performance metrics

Aggregations and joins for combined insights

5. Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to the cleaned dataset

Created key visuals such as:

KPI Cards (Total Sales, Average Profit, etc.)

Category-wise breakdowns (using bar/pie charts)

Trend analysis (using line charts)

Interactive filters/slicers for deeper insights

6. Report & Presentation

# Summarized findings in a Gamma presentation (PPT)

# Highlighted:
